# Landscape
Source codes for "Steering ecological-evolutionary dynamics to improve  artificial selection of microbial communities"
Directories in Codes are ordered according to figures.
* Figure 2: B: /Figure2BC/main_Figure2B_QuiverAttractor.m
            C: /Figure2BC/main_Figure2C_LandscapePlot.m
            D: see /Figure5/NoSpike.
* Figure 3: A: The simulation codes are in /Figure3_simu.
            B: The landscape and attractor are the same as Figure 2(B,C)
Modify line 4 to specify the number of cycles.
* /Figure5: The simulation and calculation codes for Figure 5.
  * /Spike: 30% of Newborn's biomass was replaced by H cells.
  * /NoSpike: No spike during simulation.
* /Figure6_simu: The simulation codes for dynamics plotted in Figure 6.
Modify line 4 to specify the number of cycles. Modify line 6, 7, 11 to specify the selection scheme.
