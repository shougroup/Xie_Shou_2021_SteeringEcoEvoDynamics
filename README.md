Source codes for "Steering ecological-evolutionary dynamics to improve  artificial selection of microbial communities"
Directories in Codes are ordered according to figures.
* /Figure2BC: The codes for Figure2B-C. The data plotted D-E are generated using codes from Figure5/NoSpike.
* /Figure3_simu: The simulation and calculation codes for Figure 3. 
Modify line 4 to specify the number of cycles.
* /Figure5: The simulation and calculation codes for Figure 5.
  * /Spike: 30% of Newborn's biomass was replaced by H cells.
  * /NoSpike: No spike during simulation.
* /Figure6_simu: The simulation codes for dynamics plotted in Figure 6.
Modify line 4 to specify the number of cycles. Modify line 6, 7, 11 to specify the selection scheme.
