# Examples to run the simulation codes.
## Example1: simulating community selection of H-M community when only *f<sub>P</sub>* is modified by mutations.
## Example2: simulating community selection of H-M community when 6 phenotypes can be modified by mutations.
## Example3: simulating community selection of H-M community with large Newborn size when only *f<sub>P</sub>* is modified by mutations.
